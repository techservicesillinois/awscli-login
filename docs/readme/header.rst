The ``awscli-login`` plugin allows retrieving temporary Amazon credentials
by authenticating against a SAML Identity Provider (IdP).  This
application is fully supported under Linux, macOS, and Windows.

This product is supported by the Cybersecurity Development team at the 
University of Illinois, on a best-effort basis. The expected End-of-Life
and End-of-Support date of this version is October 2028, the same as
its primary dependencies: the AWS CLI and 
`Python V3.12 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0693/#lifespan>`_.
